[Aeroseal duct sealing](https://rapidresponseacservices.com/services/aeroseal-duct-sealing/) is an innovative technology used to seal leaks in air ducts from the inside. Unlike traditional methods, Aeroseal involves injecting a polymer sealant into the ductwork, which locates and seals leaks, ensuring no loss of conditioned air. This method significantly improves HVAC efficiency, reduces energy costs, and enhances indoor air quality. By choosing Aeroseal duct sealing from Rapid Response AC Services, homeowners can ensure their HVAC system operates optimally, delivering better comfort and energy savings.
